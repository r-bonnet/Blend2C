# Blend2C
Blending product Blend2C provide from CNRS-Cerfacs 

The following files are the Blend2C products. Two types of files are available: one generated using the full method (e.g., Blend2C_ranked_members_BLEND_obs_dec_XXXX_MED_JJA.csv), and one using only the first step of the method (e.g., Blend2C_ranked_members_SubsetOBS_XXXX_MED_JJA.csv), where XXXX represents the climate index used for the observational constraint (e.g., AMV, NAO, etc.).
Data are available for the three European regions (MED, WCE, and NEU) for both summer (JJA) and winter (DJF). The climate indices used may vary depending on the region and the season.
If the first step of the method does not provide added value and instead leads to a degradation of the forecast compared to HIST for all tested climate indices, no files are provided. This is the case for DJF NEU.
